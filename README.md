# MS-102 Microsoft 365 Platform Notes

This repository contains my applied notes and platform thinking from MS-102, focused on how Microsoft 365 is run in real enterprise environments.

It is organised around the areas that matter most for day-to-day Microsoft 365 administration:
- Identity and access (Entra ID)
- Endpoint and device management (Intune)
- Security controls and policy
- Governance and service ownership
- Operational practices and continuous improvement

The goal is clarity and real-world usefulness, not copy and paste course notes.

## Repository map

- `identity/` Entra ID, admin roles, authentication, access patterns
- `endpoint/` Intune concepts, device trust, compliance, update strategy
- `security/` Defender and Purview concepts, security-by-design notes
- `governance/` Platform governance, roles, guardrails, decision records
- `operations/` Health checks, incident patterns, change considerations
- `templates/` Reusable templates for docs in this repo

## How I use these notes

Each topic is written as:
- What the control or concept is
- Why it matters in enterprise environments
- A simple recommended approach
- Common pitfalls
- What to validate and monitor
