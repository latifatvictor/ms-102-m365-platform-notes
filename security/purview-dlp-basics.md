# Microsoft Purview and Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

## What this is
This document describes how Microsoft Purview and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) help protect sensitive data across Microsoft 365.

While Defender focuses on threats, Purview focuses on data.

## Why this matters
In a Modern Workplace:
- Data is accessed from many devices
- Files are shared across Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint
- Users work remotely and collaborate externally

Without data protection:

- Business risk increases
